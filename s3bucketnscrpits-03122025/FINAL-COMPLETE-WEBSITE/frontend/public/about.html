                        <h3>The Problem Identified</h3>
                        <p>Our founders, seasoned AWS architects, noticed a critical gap in the market: while large GSIs offered scale but lacked specialization, and boutique consultants provided expertise but couldn't scale, no one was delivering both industry-specific expertise AND scalable solutions with guaranteed outcomes.</p>

                        <h3>Industry Specialization Focus</h3>
                        <p>We made the strategic decision to hyper-specialize in three critical sectors: Education (with FERPA/COPPA expertise), Retail (omnichannel transformation), and SMB (cost-effective scaling). This allowed us to develop deep domain knowledge that generalists couldn't match.</p>
