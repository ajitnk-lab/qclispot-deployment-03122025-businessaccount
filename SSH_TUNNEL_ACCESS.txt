# VS Code Server - SSH Tunnel Access (Faster Loading)

Instead of accessing via browser directly, use SSH tunnel for faster performance:

## Step 1: Create SSH Tunnel
Run this command on your LOCAL machine:

ssh -i amazon-q-key-uswest2.pem -L 8080:localhost:8080 ubuntu@44.224.150.192

## Step 2: Access VS Code
Open browser and go to:

http://localhost:8080

This routes traffic through SSH tunnel which is much faster and more reliable.

## Alternative: Check your network
The 11MB JavaScript files are taking too long to download from us-west-2.
- Try from a different network
- Check if you have bandwidth limitations
- Consider deploying in a region closer to your location

Current instance: us-west-2a
